      Over the course of human history, science has developed from our early understanding of fire, wind, water, and 
      earth to exploring everything from galaxies far away to the very building blocks of life itself.
      The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can experience the wonders of our discoveries and 
      perhaps even ignite a lifelong passion to continue the exploration of the world around us.

      We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but brought to live through exhibits. This is 
      why we have over 1000 different exhibits on the many varied subjects of science to explore. Many of these 
      exhibits are designed for you to interact with and play around to see science come to life (apart from the 
      dinosaur exhibits – they only come to life at night when everyone’s gone home).

        <p class="article_text">
          A number of people volunteer their time and effort to keep the displays in good order and ready 
          for visitors to come and enjoy. Volunteering has its perks including getting to see behind the scenes 
          of a working museum, access to staff- only lectures, and a monthly lunch where all staff and volunteers 
          come together to discuss ideas for future exhibits and strategies for the museum.
        </p>
        <p class="article_text">
          You can help volunteer in a number of different spheres. Please contact us if you’d like to find out
          more about how you can get involved.
